          <p class="w3-xlarge"> In 1980, Roger Sargent was going through personal life challenges and wanted to begin to work in a field to support his two children on his own. Also having the knowledge of steam cleaning under his belt and having the desire to make people happy, Roger took the leap of faith and decided to start his own business for carpet cleaning. What kept people calling him back was the results that they saw and what motivated Roger to keep going was the satisifaction on customer's faces. Scott was only in high school at the time, so he began working part time with his father. After seeing his passion, Scott decided to pass the opportunity of leaving for college to work hands on to run the business and ever since they have been a wonderful team. In 2018, Roger had faced the difficult decision to retire for medical reason, but he retired proud and confident knowing that he left the business to Scott Sargent.</p>
